# Development Guidelines

## General Principles

- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Follow the existing code patterns and structure
- Test thoroughly before committing changes
- Update documentation when adding new features

## Smart Contract Development

### Before Writing Contracts

1. Plan the contract architecture and data structures
2. Consider gas optimization and security implications
3. Review similar contracts or standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.)

### Testing Requirements

- Write comprehensive tests in `sc/test/` for all contracts
- Include both unit tests and fuzz tests where appropriate
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Run `forge test` before committing

### Deployment

- Use deployment scripts in `sc/script/`
- Test on local networks (anvil) before mainnet
- Verify contracts on block explorers after deployment

## Frontend Development

### Before Writing Components

1. Plan the component structure and data flow
2. Consider user experience and accessibility
3. Design responsive layouts for mobile and desktop

### Code Quality

- Run `npm run lint` before committing
- Ensure TypeScript compiles without errors
- Test components in different browsers
- Optimize images and assets

### Web3 Integration

- Always handle wallet disconnection gracefully
- Show clear error messages for failed transactions
- Implement proper loading states
- Consider transaction confirmation times

## Git Workflow

- Create feature branches for new work
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Test before pushing to remote

## Documentation

- Update [README.md](mdc:README.md) when adding major features
- Comment complex logic in code
- Document API changes in contract interfaces
- Include usage examples for new features

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Smart contracts have input validation
- [ ] No hardcoded private keys or secrets
- [ ] Error handling for all external calls
- [ ] Gas optimization considered
- [ ] Reentrancy protection where needed
- [ ] Frontend validates user inputs
- [ ] Sensitive data not exposed in client-side code
